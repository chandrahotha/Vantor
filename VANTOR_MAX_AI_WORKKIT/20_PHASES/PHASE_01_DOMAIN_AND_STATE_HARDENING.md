# Phase 01 — DOMAIN AND STATE HARDENING

## Objective

Centralize state transitions, authority policy, approval flow and canonical matching.

## Required behavior

- Inspect the current code before editing.
- Identify all callers and tests of any function/endpoint being changed.
- Make the smallest coherent change that establishes one canonical rule.
- Add or update regression tests before declaring completion.
- Run targeted tests, then the wider suite.
- Update implementation map and changelog.

## Exit criteria

No duplicate rule implementations; exhaustive transition/role tests pass.

## Do not do

- Do not invent missing business requirements.
- Do not silently remove functionality.
- Do not leave duplicate competing implementations of the same rule.
- Do not mark a phase complete merely because code compiles.
